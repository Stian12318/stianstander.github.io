                    But now it can become even more...</span> <br> Data Science, according to a few studies, will become
                more and more
                important up
                until the year 2030. It is a mathematical skill and it is in high demand all over the world.</p>
            <h3 class="text">What is Data Science and how I would use it?</h3>
            <p>Let's say a Solar Panel Company wants to develop an app that proves the quality
                of their products. This company is a start up and is looking for new talent to develop this app but
                wants to spend as little money as possible. They might end up splitting up the work between a
                small team of developers and data scientists but they're a small company.<br><br>
                The goal is to build an app that also demonstrates how much power their Panels can make in the right
                circumstances. As a web developer you can use resources like <a
                    href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/getting-started.html?s_eid=PSM_15028">MatLab</a>
                which doesn't do the work for you but saves you from learning several brand new languages like Python or
                R.</p>
            <p>Or you could use PyCharm or Jupyter Notebooks that work with Python. <a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> has
                some of the best resources for quickly picking up some new skills.</p>
            <p>After learning some new skills you can help companies with projects that you previously had to design
                with a team.</p>

                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyse and predict generated power at maximum sun exposure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Location</strong>: Natick, Massachusetts.</p>
                    <p>Let's use MatLab for this project and focus on predicting the power generated.<br> We'll do this
                        by using data collected from a business with solar panels in an excel file. The excel file gives
                        the recorded data of a very sunny
                        day which makes it ideal for predicting max power output.</p>

                        <p>First we open up MatLab in the <a href="https://matlab.mathworks.com/">browser</a> and then

                        <p>Above is a mathematical equation that is commonly used to calculate how much

                        <p>We set up a few "constants" or variables to use in our calculations. This will allow
                            us to build the previously mentioned formula in MatLab.<br>
                            The above variables are called <strong>dec</strong> (declination of the sun) and
                            <strong>lat</strong>
                            (latitude of the solar
                            panels). <strong>lat</strong> and <strong>dec</strong> are values that we can look up.
                            <strong>lat</strong>
                            depends on the
                            latitude of the
                            location. See below: <br><img src="images\slide4.1.png"> <br>
                            And <strong>dec</strong> is simply how high the sun gets on a given day. We'll use a very
                            sunny day to calculate the max output.

                                useful, it processes math in a familiar way and has several saved libraries of functions
                                and

                        <p><strong>t</strong>(time) will be used as the x-axis in our first model. The modelling of data
                            is
                            quite an important step and will take some time to get used to whenever working with new
                            technology. <strong>t</strong> will be broken up into 15min increments (hence the 0.25) and
                            will continue from 5:30am (hence the 5.5) till 8pm (hence the 20).
                        <p>Next we should calculate the <strong>LST</strong> (local solar time) as that is what the
                            formula requires. Our
                            time and LST is not the same so
                            another calculation is needed.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/solar-time">LST</a> does
                            not take into account daylight savings or local time zones. That is why we make it
                            equal to <strong>t</strong> but subtract 1 hour for daylight savings and then we add 14.6
                            mins per 60mins for time correction. Time correction can be calculated like this:
                            <br><em>4*(75-71.35) = 14.6 minutes.</em><br>
                            It says 4 multiplies by (longitude of the current time zone minus longitude of solar
                            panels). And as stated in
                            the above LST link that I shared "The factor of 4 minutes comes from the fact that the Earth
                            rotates 1Â° every 4 minutes".

                            degrees. MatLab has special functions for scenarios where sin, cos or tan needs to use
                            degrees and in this case it's simply called <strong>cosd</strong>:<br>

                        <p>Let's set up <strong>S_inc</strong>. This tells us the effect of the atmosphere on sun
                            exposure. So the best exposure would be when the sun is at it's peak in the afternoon.
                            That's when the sun is right on top of the building and passes through the shortest distance

                            at each time stamp:</p>

                        <p>We start by using <strong>plot</strong> and then adding in the two graphs. First we add the
                            collected data of the 26th of June with <strong>tfullday,dayofinterest,'.-'</strong> and
                            then our calculated max kW for a day with <strong>t,production_theory</strong> and seperate
                            them wih a comma.</p>

                        <p>Above we can see the final result to prove that these solar panels ,<strong>AH3</strong>, are
                            performing optimally. And just to remind you again all of these labels in these graphs can
                            either be coded or labeled.</p>
